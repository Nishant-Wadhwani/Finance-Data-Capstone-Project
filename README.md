# Finance-Data-Capstone-Project
In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. Keep in mind, this project is just meant to practice our visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be  a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice. We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016. We'll need to install pandas-datareader for this to work!  Pandas datareader allows you to read stock information directly from  the internet. We need to get data using pandas datareader. We will get stock information for the following banks:  1.Bank of America 2.CitiGroup 3.Goldman Sachs 4.JPMorgan Chase 5.Morgan Stanley 6.Wells Fargo
